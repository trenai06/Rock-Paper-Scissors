// 1.Â page layout
// 2. styling (crop header image some more)(color scheme)(button size)(font size) (background color for game container)
// 3.  button for player images and submit button
// 4. maybe highlight or pop out the area that has been chosen (maybe just on hover)
// 5. computer needs to generate rock paper or scissors 
let computer = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]
let i = Math.floor(Math.random() * computer.length)
console.log(computer[i])

/* 6. Player makes a choice. get the value of the choice to compare to the computer "String" */

    




// 7. alert saying if player has won, lost or tied (when game is lost say paper covers rock, rock smashes scissors, scissors cut paper)
// 8. display players choice and computer's choice  (maybe two box areas with pics. highlight computer's choice
//     after player has guessed, as well as player's guess. )
// 9. only one round involved and then game is refreshed



//set an empty array for player choice 


/// dont use the array, give each button an id and call it that way. Set it to a variable. let that variable equal a string to compare to the array string


// function results(){
//     document.getElementById("submit").innerHTML = "You Win!!"
    // document.getElementById("submit").innerHTML = "You Lose"
    // document.getElementById("submit").innerHTML = "You Tied"
// }
